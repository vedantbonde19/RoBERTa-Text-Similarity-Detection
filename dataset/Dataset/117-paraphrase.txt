"Encyclopedia," as defined by the Greeks, is everyday knowledge that can be obtained by schooling.  However, European writers expanded that definition to encompass the universal array of learning that has been discovered and is available to mankind.  The complete body of this knowledge must then be cataloged in a specific system; by alphabetical order, subject area, or etc., to be considered an encyclopedia.
