I was very confused by all the shouting which I heard coming through the church window. Not only that but H. Nevil gave the bride away and it was all because of my influence. I knew it could never be a profitable deal. The bride was breaking her heart inside the carriage and she kept on crying at the station. It was all a bit too much for me.
