Once we were driving through the beautiful valley of the Corace which was surrounded by orange-groves and pine woods. The stunning valley comprised of beautiful things like plants laurels and myrtles with trees of carobs and olive adding to the beauty of the surroundings. The rain was pouring so heavily that it made the driving extremely difficult. Looking at the fierceness of the wind and storm blowing the branches and leaves of the woods. The whole scene looked like clouds flowing above the sea in the storm.
