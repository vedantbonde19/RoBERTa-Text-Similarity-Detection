Nobody knows why there was darkness all around. The steamer hooted as if it is going to die down. People were not in a position to understand if there was a problem with the steamer as there was still time left for midnight to set in. There was darkness around and no one was in a position to predict the reason. Finally the mate appeared and asked "why there was darkness in the cabin?"
