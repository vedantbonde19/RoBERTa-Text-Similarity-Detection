On Sunday, day and night, Joe spent his time with his acquaintances.
Near the house, there were many moose though there is no caribou or deer. 
There is a man from old town whose out hunting for moose near the house. The old man has killed 10 or 12 moose in the past year. So they all could hear his gunshot very near to the house.
