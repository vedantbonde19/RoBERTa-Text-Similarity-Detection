"Thanks Be to God," is a term very commonly heard.  An Indian cheif of the neighborhood Surgert, came to the formal founding of this term on Sunday September 25th.  Once the cheif was assured by priests and soilers that no hard should come to his people or him by the noise of exploding gunpowder, he proclaimed, "Thanks be to God!"
