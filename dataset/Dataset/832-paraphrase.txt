I couldn't help but look at the snake while it was slithering on me and flicking me with his tongue, even though I wanted nothing more than to be able to avert my eyes somehow.  No sooner did the snake leave did I notice a dark figure heading in my direction holding a yam stick or gunnai stick.  When I tried to get up and run, I realized that I couldn't.
