Initially it was quite difficult. But, in time, James and I became more experienced at the chores Mrs. Sweedle required and were capable of finishing them (although without a moment to spare). However, there was one tough time when we were rushing to complete the cleaning and Mrs. Sweedleâ€™s brother got very upset with us. That was really a bummer!
