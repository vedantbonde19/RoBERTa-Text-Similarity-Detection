You need some soft fruits for this sauce, like strawberries, raspberries or blackberries. For a firm texture mix together a cup of sugar and half a cup of unsalted butter. Cream them together and add lemon peel or lemon juice. Form the mixture into whatever shape you like and then it is ready to serve.
