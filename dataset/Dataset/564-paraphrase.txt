I have heard from many people that it can be difficult to maintain the level of heat they need at all times, which makes it difficult to keep mature ones for a long period of time, and even more difficult to raise them from infancy.  They are sensitive to many things, so it's very easy to feed them the wrong thing, which could cause problems with digestion.
